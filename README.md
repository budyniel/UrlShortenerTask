# UrlShortenerTask
Application accepts any link in correct format, saves it to database and returns shorten link which can be used instead of given link.
Users can also check all links they shortened in "All Links" tab, which shows both original and shorten URLs.

I didn't pay much attention to UI design - just enough to be readable.
I used basic encoding/decoding functionality based on Id for creating my links.
Also I tried my best to follow DDD architecture but it isn't really my forte.
